# The wp-tailwind-system skill must carry the full decision ladder and the
# prohibition list, so agents cannot fall back to the BEM/custom-property path.
#
# Round 2. All four prohibitions were gated by a bare presence grep for their
# SUBJECT ('assets/css/styles.css', 'BEM', ':root', 'new director'). An assertion
# shaped like that fires when the text is DELETED and never when it is REVERSED:
# a Forbidden list rewritten so that `assets/css/styles.css` is "the shared
# output surface for every template" and a `:root` block is fine "whenever
# `@theme` is inconvenient" still printed PASS, because both subjects are still
# named. A prohibition is a direction, not a word. Each of the four is now read
# out of its OWN list item and has to state the ban.
#
# The scoping/flattening helpers are lifted from tests/checks/wp-yolo-tailwind.sh
# and tests/checks/wp-init-tailwind.sh rather than reinvented; the long rationale
# for each lives there. Only `bullet_about` is new, and only because this file has
# to pick the item a subject BELONGS to: ':root' appears in two Forbidden items —
# the one that bans it, and the BEM item that names it in passing — and "the first
# item that mentions it" is a coin toss that a list reorder flips.
#
# Round 2 also closes a false-fail. The second decision-ladder rung was gated by
# the literal `2 pages`, so `2+ pages` — the very form this skill's own "Repeated"
# paragraph uses — exited 1 with "skill missing decision-ladder element '2 pages'".
# The threshold is a claim about a number, so it now accepts the forms a careful
# author writes for it (`≥2`, `2+`, `two or more`, `at least 2`) and still rejects
# an unrelated one (`≥7 pages`, `3+ pages`).

# list truncates the clause and the gate reports an EMPTY set, and brace notation
# (`{base,components,layouts,utilities}`) leaves `{base` and `utilities}` failing
# the bare-name pattern, so it reports a WRONG set of two.
#
# The run-walker ported from that file instead: walk the file's backticked spans in
# order, split each on commas, braces and spaces, and grow a RUN of bare lowercase
# names. Anything that is not a bare name — a path (`assets/css/src/tailwindcss/`,
# `utilities/site.css`), `@apply`, `template=basic` — ends the run, so the runs are
# exactly the lists an author writes. Take the first run that names two or more of
# the four sanctioned directories, and compare it whole: a fifth name lands in the
# same run and fails the comparison, a renamed one fails it too, and deleting the
# list leaves no qualifying run at all. Trailing slashes are stripped, so `base/`
# is the same sanctioned name as `base`. `|| true` because `pipefail` turns an empty
# grep into a silent `set -e` abort that exits 1 without ever printing FAIL.
# One difference from the migrate version, and it is required here: that one walks a
# single Step region, this one walks the WHOLE skill, so the PROSE BETWEEN two spans
# has to be able to end a run too. Feeding the walker only `grep -oE '`[^`]+`'` throws
# the gaps away, and the first thing it did on this file was glue the enumeration's
# `utilities` to the `layouts/` of the next PARAGRAPH ("`layouts/` in particular is
# absent until something writes into it") and report a five-token run. So the text is
# split into span lines (prefixed \001) and gap lines, and a gap is transparent only
# when it is list glue — commas, semicolons, whitespace, "and", "or". Anything else,
# including the ". Never create a fifth." that separates those two mentions, ends the
# run. Erring toward ending it is the safe direction: it can only shorten a run, and a
# run must still carry two of the four sanctioned names to be the enumeration at all.
# Triple-backtick FENCE markers are turned into gaps first, before the inline-code split
# runs, or the pairing consumes them and reads the file-layout fence's BODY as span text

# The set gate above reads ONE clause — the four-name enumeration — and the

# inside the layouts/ carve-out sentence ("Any of the four — and `overrides/`,
# when a project needs it — may be created …") printed PASS, and so did adding
# `overrides/plugin.css` to the file-layout code fence. The carve-out is exactly
# the sentence that must not open the door to a fifth, so it is gated by name
# here rather than by trusting the enumeration to speak for the whole file.
#
# A CSS source directory reference is a bare lowercase name plus `/`, followed by
# nothing (`layouts/`) or by a single .css filename (`utilities/site.css`,
# `components/<slug>.css`). Everything is first split on non-path characters, one
# token per line, so the pattern anchors at both ends: that is what keeps
# `assets/css/styles.css` and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/…` (multi-segment paths),
# `page/template` (prose) and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (leading dot) out, and it is
# also why the scan cannot be defeated by two directory names sitting next to
# each other — an inline grep consumes the delimiter between them and misses the
# second. Read from the flattened text so a wrap between a name and its filename
# cannot hide one. LC_ALL=C safe: the class is byte-wise, so `≥` and `—` split
# into separators under either locale rather than joining tokens.
#
# `bin` is exempt: it is the PLUGIN's script directory, which the Verify section
# names twice — once in the fenced command and once in the prose warning about a
# bare relative `bin/…` path, whose ellipsis splits off and leaves a bare `bin/`.
# It is not a directory under assets/css/src/tailwindcss/, and the Verify path is
# gated on its own below.
# SCOPED to the two sections that speak for the CSS source tree — `## File layout`
# (its prose, its carve-out sentence and its layout fence) and `## Forbidden`. It used
# to read the WHOLE file, and a pattern that cannot tell a CSS-source directory from
# any other path reddened on two ordinary, correct additions:
#
#   "The build compiles `main.css` into `dist/main.css`; never hand-edit it."
#     -> FAIL: the skill names CSS source director(y|ies) [dist] …
#   "Read the converted page in `demo/` before authoring."
#     -> FAIL: … [demo] …
#
# Neither sentence is about the source tree, and a gate that fails on correct work
# gets muted. Both sections are still read whole, so the two controls that MUST keep
# failing still do: `overrides/` smuggled into the layouts/ carve-out sentence, and
# `overrides/plugin.css` added to the file-layout fence.
#
# Ceiling, stated because it is the cost of the narrowing: a `name/` token inside
# File layout or Forbidden is read as a directory of the CSS source tree, whatever it
# means — a sentence about `dist/` or `demo/` belongs in Tokens or Verify, not there —
